Changes I decided to make to design:

	// General Changes

		- Used Abstract Class instead of Interface for "List" and "ListItem"	

	// List

		- changed owner to use ListUser
		- changed editListName to setListName
		- changed addItem and deleteItem parameters to take in ListItem
		- changed addUser and setOwner parameters to take in ListUser
		- added list as attribute to store ListItems
		- added deleteUser method
		- changed type of listType from String to ListType (Enumeration)
		- changed method name pruneListItems to clearFinishedListItems
		- added toggleItem() method

	// ListItem

		- took away option of pending status for status attribute
		- using enum Status for status attribute
		- changed listItemType to use enum ListType
		- added method toggleComplete()

	// Shopping List

		- took away shoppingList attribute because the list will be in the abstract class List

	// ShoppingListItem

		- added quantity attribute
		- added setters and getters for quantity

	// ToDoListItem
		
		- changed startDate and endDate type from Date to LocalDateTime
		- taking away feature of calcluating priority by due date. gonna show list items in order by due date and then priority will take precedence after that
		- removed method calculateItemPriority
		- added getDaysUntilDue()
		- added isOverDue()


	// ToDoList

		- changed calculateListPriority to calcualteListOrder

	// GoalList

		- took away goalItems because it is implemented by List
		- took away methods because all of the methods for GoalList are derived from List

	// GoalListItem

		- changed child to children to represent attribute better

	// TeamListItem

		- added itemPriority attribute for spec requirement
		- added deadline for spec req
		- took away goalItems because it doesn't match spec

	// ListDriver

		- Added owner attribute for ListUser
		- Added a delete method for every list type except goal
		- Added attribute for enabledLists
		- took away maxUsers and statusNames because not needed
		- added a toggleList() method to enable or disable a list type
		- added cleanAllLists() method to get rid of items completed for 24 hours 

	// ListSettings

		- deleted this class entirely because only useful attribute is enabledLists and I just added that to the ListDriver as an attribute
